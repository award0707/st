st - simple terminal
--------------------
st is a simple terminal emulator for X which sucks less.


Requirements
------------
In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (st is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running st
----------
If you did not install st with make clean install, you must compile
the st terminfo entry with the following command:

    tic -sx st.info

See the man page for additional details.

                if the window is resized (e.g., moved from master to stack)
blinking cursor
theme - alt0-9 change theme.
scheme framework - ST can receive signals (e.g. SIGUSR1) to change
                   theme. so, a theme change elsewhere can change the
                   theme of all open ST clients
themed cursor

schemesel themes, in order:
st, candle dark, rose pine, rose pine dawn, solarized dark,
solarized light, tomorrow night blue, acme, moonfly
